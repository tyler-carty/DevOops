For the `Repository name`, please make sure you enter your team's name so that we can keep track of the different repositories.

If your team is building multiple components and requires multiple repositories, fork this repository and enter the team name followed by the name of the component.

For example, if you have a `frontend` and `backend` application, the first fork can be called `TeamName-frontend` and the second fork can be called `TeamName-backend`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're only building a single component, you can leave the `Repository name` as `TeamName`.

Once you've entered the name, select `Create fork`:

### Add Collaborators

Now that you've created your own fork, if another member within your team wants to contribute to the code, you would need to add them as a collaborator.

To do so, navigate to the repository containing your fork and click on `Settings`:

Then select the `Collaborators` option in the navigation menu on the left:

Select `Add people`:

And search for the `username`, `full name`, or `email` of the member you want to add to the repository.

Then they can clone your repository and contribute code to your fork.

> [!NOTE]
> Please make sure to add them to your forked version of the repository. You won't be able to add them here directly.

### How to sign in to GitHub Copilot

IT@LBG request will need to have been raised and completed before you can do the below:
 
Once you've been given a licence you'll be sent your username in an email (to your LBG email address).

When logging in use the username you've been given (example: charlotte-Boults_lbgghcp) this will remove the password field and redirect you to the Microsoft sign in page.

On the Microsoft sign in page use your LBG global credentials (example:Charlotte.boults@lloydsbanking.com) and password you use to log into your work device.

Once authentication is complete you should be re-directed to GitHub Copilot home page.

Now you're ready to start. Happy coding!
